### **Netflix Advertising Strategy – Business Report using LLMs and Quarto**
*2025 | BUSI 654 – Application of AI in Business | Individual Business Report*

**Overview:**
Created a comprehensive business report analyzing Netflix's advertising and market strategy, using large language models (LLMs) and Quarto to structure and present the work. This project explores the intersection of AI-assisted research and strategic business analysis, examining how LLMs can enhance (but not replace) human judgment in developing marketing campaigns.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Strategic analysis of Netflix's ad-supported tier in competitive streaming landscape
- Development of "Watch More, Pay Less" campaign targeting price-sensitive but quality-conscious viewers aged 18–38
- Critical evaluation of LLM outputs versus human-refined strategic content
- Human evaluation framework for assessing campaign quality beyond AI-generated metrics
- Unconventional metrics for measuring campaign success and expectation management

**Skills Applied:** Business research, competitive analysis, marketing strategy, AI-assisted content development, critical thinking, human evaluation frameworks, technical documentation with Quarto

### **Service Improvement Case Study – Retirement Living Dining Services**
*Case study based on experience as Dietary Aide at Venvi Retirement Living (formerly Revera Hollyburn House)*
